# About the Bot

Terminus-Bot is an IRC bot written in Ruby under the MIT license. Its purpose
is to completely avoid the problems of other bots.

The authors of the project are long-time IRC bot users and know how things can
go badly or be confusing. Hopefully, we can address all of the problems we
have encountered, as well as all of those everyone else tells us about.

# Requirements

* Linux
* Ruby 1.9.3 or higher (2.0 appears to be compatible -- let me know if you have
  any problems with it)
* gems (mandatory)
    * eventmachine
    * psych (included psych has UTF-8 bugs)
    * htmlentities
    * json
    * dnsruby (dns script)
    * em-http-request (http_client module and all scripts that use it)
    * em-whois (whois script)
    * ruby-mpd (mpd script)
* Script Dependencies
    * netutils: ping, ping6, mtr

# How to use Terminus-Bot

## Installation

Terminus-Bot does not currently support system-wide installation. It may
eventually be made into a gem, but for now you simply download the code and
run it from somewhere in your home directory.

To get the latest Terminus-Bot code, type

    git clone git://github.com/kabaka/Terminus-Bot.git

_Once the bot has reached beta version, there will be separate downloads for
releases of the bot._

## Configuration

Included with the bot is a file called `terminus-bot.conf.dist`. This file
contains the documentation for and examples of the bot's configuration. Using
this file as an example, create `terminus-bot.conf` in the same directory.

*Pay close attention to the documentation in the example configuration file!*
Some configuration values are _required_ for the bot to operate, and many of
them _must_ be in a specific format. Until configuration validation is added
(it will be before the first beta), using invalid configuration values or
leaving out required settings may result in unpredictable behavior or crashes.

By default, the bot will load almost all scripts. The only scripts left out
are those used by developers for debugging, such as the lograw script which
logs every message the bot sees. Refer to the [Scripts](#scripts) section of
this document for a list of scripts and what they do.

Also worth noting are the modules. For a list of modules, refer to the
[Modules](#modules) section of this document.

## Scripts

This is a complete list of all official scripts that are distributed with the
bot. Commands provided by each script are listed here. For more complete
information on what a command does and how to use it, you should view the
on-IRC help for the command by using the [help script's](#help) HELP command.

In these examples, the command prefix used is @. When using the bot, be sure to
use whichever command prefix you set in the core configuration block.

### Account

Create and log in to bot accounts. This script is required if you want access to
administrative functions.

Commands:

* IDENTIFY - Log in to the bot.
* REGISTER - Register a new account on the bot.
* PASSWORD - Change your bot account password.
* FPASSWORD - Change another user's bot account password.
* LEVEL - Change a user's account level.
* ACCOUNT - Display information about a user.
* WHOAMI - Display your current user information if you are logged in.

### Admin

Manage the bot's core functionality.

Commands:

* RELOAD - Reload one or more scripts.
* UNLOAD - Unload one or more scripts.
* LOAD - Load the specified script.
* REHASH - Reload the configuration file.
* NICK - Change the bot's nick for the current connection.
* QUIT - Kill the bot.
* RECONNECT - Reconnect the specified connection.

### Away

Announce away status in channel when users are highlighted. This is pretty
annoying, but some archaic IRC clients don't know how to mark away users in the
nick list, so this _can_ be useful.

Commands:

* AWAY - Enable or disable away status announcements for the current channel.

### Battle

Facilitate PRNG-based role-play battle games. No turn-based enforcement is done,
so it is up to the users how to use this. Once a battle is started, interaction
is done with IRC actions (/me). For example:

    <@Kabaka> @battle start
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka has started a battle!
    <Terminus-Bot> To attack other players, use /me attacks TARGET with ITEM
    <Terminus-Bot> You may check the health of active players by using the HEALTH command.
    * Kabaka attacks aji with Hammer of Thor
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka's Hammer of Thor hits aji for 12 damage.
    <Terminus-Bot> aji has 88 health remaining.
    * aji attacks Kabaka with pointy sticks
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka absorbs the hit and gains 20 health!
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka has 120 health remaining.

Starting health, the amount of damage that is possible, and the chance of hits
being ineffective is all configurable in terminus-bot.conf. Any players in the
channel may join in at any time. In large channels, this can get incredibly
hectic, so it is strongly recommended that this script only be used in smaller
channels.

Commands:

* BATTLE - Start, stop, or reset the battle in the current channel.
* HEALTH - View the health of all active players in this channel.
* HEAL - Heal players to maximum health.

### Chanlog

Log channel activity to disk. To disable logging for a specific channel, use the
bot's script flags to disable the script in those channels. Logs are written to
`var/terminus-bot/chanlog/` with the file name format `server.channel.log`.

This script is still experimental and will be subject to extensive changes before beta.

### Channels

Join and part channels, and maintain the list of channels the bot tries to
occupy. Without this script loaded, the bot will not attempt to join any 
channels and will not rejoin channels the next time it starts.

Commands:

* JOIN - Join a channel with optional key.
* PART - Part a channel
* CYCLE - Part and then join a channel.
* JOINCHANS - Force the join channels event.

### Choose

Lets the bot make decisions for you. There are two types of questions you may
ask the bot: Yes/no questions and questions with multiple answers.

To ask a question, begin your message with the bot's commmand prefix followed
by a space. For example:

    <Kabaka> @ Should I go to bed?
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka: No

    <Kabaka> @ Ruby, Python, or C?
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka: Ruby

will not be able to respond to things like CTCP PING and CTCP VERSION.

Available CTCPs:

* VERSION - Reply with the bot's version.
* URL - Reply with the bot's home page address.
* TIME - Reply with the current time, formatted according to RFC 822.

### Flags

Manage the bot's script flags table.

This script is experimental and will be subject to change before beta.

Terminus-Bot allows you to enable or disable scripts per-channel. This is done
using script "flags." Flags can be on or off for any script in any channel on
any server.

When accessing or modifying the flags table, wildcards are supported.

For example, if we want to disable all scripts on the Freenode network:

    <Kabaka> @disable freenode * *

If we want to see what scripts are enabled in the #Terminus-Bot channel on 
StaticBox:

    <Kabaka> @flags freenode #Terminus-Bot *

Commands:

valid bot ID (like an API key) is required to use this script.

To talk to the bot once interactivity is enabled, simple begin your messages
with the bot's nick like you might do when speaking to another user in the
channel.

Conversations are tracked per-channel, not per-user. So when multiple users
in one channel are talking to the bot, it will consider them all to be the
same person.

    <Kabaka> @pandora on
    <Terminus-Bot> Pandorabot interaction enabled.
    <Kabaka> Terminus-Bot: Hi
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka: Hello there!

Commands:

* PING - Measure the time it takes for the bot to receive a reply to a CTCP
PING from your client.

### Pong

Reply to server PINGs. Without this script loaded, the bot will frequently
disconnect due to ping timeouts.

### Raw

Commands:

* RAW - Send raw text over the IRC connection.

### Regex

Perform regular expression substitutions and searches on recent messages.

Substitutions are done with sed-like message syntax: s/regex/replacement/flags

Searches are done with: g/regex/flags

For example:

    <Kabaka> I'm writting documentation for Terminus-Bot!
    <Kabaka> s/writting/writing/
    <Terminus-Bot> <Kabaka> I'm writing documentation for Terminus-Bot!

    <Kabaka> This is a test.
    <Kabaka> s/[aeiou]//g
    <Terminus-Bot> <Kabaka> Ths s  tst.

### Relay

Relay chat between two or more channels on one or more networks.

There are multiple known problems with this script, so production use is not
recommended.

Commands:

* RELAY - Manage channel relays.
* RELAYS - List active channel relays.

### Roulette

Russian Roulette for IRC.

If the bot is a channel operator when a user loses, the bot will kick the user.
If not, it will just announce it as a channel message.

Commands:

* ROULETTE - Pull the trigger. You have a 5/6 chance of surviving.

### RPN

Reverse Polish notation (postfix) calculator.

### Speak

Allows bot admins to use the bot to speak and perform actions.

Commands:

* SAY - Speak the given text.
* ACT - Act the given text (CTCP ACTION).

### Tell

If MemoServ is available, it is almost definitely a better solution, as this
script has some privacy and abuse concerns.

Commands:

* TELL - Have the bot tell the given user something the next time they speak.

### Time

Commands:

* TIME - Get the current time with optional time format.

### Title

Display the titles of web pages when the bot sees links in channels.

Because Urban Dictionary doesn't offer an API anymore, we have to scrape the
web pages for information. Hopefully they'll have an API again at some point.

Commands:

* UD - Fetch the definition of a word from UrbanDictionary.com. If no word is
  given, fetch a random definition.

### Weather

Look up weather on wunderground.com.

## Modules

Modules are files that augment the bot's core code. They cannot be unloaded or
reloaded. Some are required by some scripts.

### buffer

A short-term, in-memory message history. It is currently not required by any
scripts, but will be eventually used by the regex script.

### caps

Client capability negotiation. With this module loaded, the bot can use modern
IRC features such as multi-prefix and SASL to help improve security and reduce
bandwidth usage. Loading this module is strongly recommended.

### http-client

Simplifies HTTP access for scripts. This module handles redirects, timeouts, and
headers.

### ignores

Allows the bot to ignore other users. This is managed by the
[ignore script](#ignore).

## First Run

After you've completed configuration of the bot, type `./terminus-bot` in the
bot's directory. The bot will load all files and then disappear into the
background. It should then connect to IRC.

Since it won't join any channels until you tell it to, you'll have to manually
open a query with it by typing `/query Terminus-Bot` (replacing "Terminus-Bot"
with whatever nick you gave the bot).

From here, you'll need to register an account with the bot. When writing the
configuration file, you should have specified at least one level 10 account in
the admins block. Use that account name to register your new account using the
`register` command in the account script.

The bot should inform you that you've been logged in. Go ahead and have it join
a channel using the channel script's `join` command.

Remember, you can use the help script's `help` command to get a list of commands
and help with specific commands. The command list will only show you commands
you are authorized to use.

## Reporting Problems

Remember, Terminus-Bot is not yet done, so some things may not work correctly.
If you get stuck, or if something just isn't working, make sure you read the
relevant help and make sure you are not making a mistake. Once you're sure
there is a problem with your Terminus-Bot, head to the IRC channel at the top
of this document and ask one of the channel operators what to do. If there is
a bug, we'll probably need you to reproduce it with debug logging enabled so
that we can get a backtrace.
