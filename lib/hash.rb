class Hash

  # Recursively format the Hash for use in an IRC message.
  #
  # This is primarily for use by {Bot::Command#reply}.
  # 
  # @example
  #     data = {
  #       'Foo' => 'bar'
  #     }
  #
  #     data.to_s_irc #=> "\02Foo:\02 bar"
  #
  # @example
  #     data = {
  #       'Foo' => {
  #         'Bar' => 'baz'
  #       }
  #     }
  #
  #     data.to_s_irc #=> "\02Foo:\02 \02Bar:\02 baz"
